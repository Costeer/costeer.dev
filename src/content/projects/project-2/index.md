This website is build on top of the fantastic Astro Nano template.

My goal was to create a personal website that is fast, minimalistic and easy to maintain. so considering my limeted experience with web development I decided to use a template that is already optimized for performance and SEO.

One of the main Inspirations for this website was the design of [Nothing's](https://nothing.tech/) Hardware and Software. I wanted to create a website that reflects this aesthetic, while also being functional and easy to navigate.

## 📦 Installation
To install the template, simply clone the repository and run the following commands:

'npm install' to install the dependencies
'npm run dev' to start the development server

and thats it! You can now start customizing the website template to fit your needs.
